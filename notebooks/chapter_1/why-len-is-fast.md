# Why `len()` Is So Fast (and How You Can Use It Too)

One of Python‚Äôs most deceptively simple functions is also one of its fastest: `len()`. At a glance, you might expect that calling `len(x)` on a string, list, or memoryview would involve some method call under the hood‚Äîafter all, this is an object-oriented language, right?

But Python, particularly **CPython**, doesn‚Äôt play by those rules when it comes to performance-critical operations. For built-in types like `str`, `list`, and `tuple`, calling `len(x)` doesn‚Äôt actually invoke a method. Instead, CPython reaches directly into the C-level struct that represents the object and reads a field that stores the length. No method dispatch, no overhead‚Äîjust raw speed.

This design is intentional. Getting the number of items in a collection is so common and fundamental that Python gives `len()` a shortcut for built-in types. It‚Äôs the same story with `abs()`, which also receives special treatment in the Python data model.

## Custom Objects and `__len__`

So how does this square with Python‚Äôs otherwise elegant and consistent object model? That‚Äôs where special methods come in.

If you define a custom class and want `len()` to work on it, all you need to do is implement the `__len__()` method:

```python
class MyCollection:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self._items = items

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._items)
```

Now, `len(MyCollection([1, 2, 3]))` will return `3`. Behind the scenes, Python checks if the object defines `__len__`, and if so, it calls it. This is a beautiful compromise between raw performance for built-in types and the flexibility and consistency that Python is known for.

## A Legacy of Language Design

This idea isn‚Äôt new. Python‚Äôs predecessor, **ABC**, had a special operator `#` for getting the length of a collection. Writing `#s` would return the length of sequence `s`, and `x#s` would count the number of times `x` appeared in `s`‚Äîsimilar to `s.count(x)` in modern Python.

Even though Python chose a functional style (`len(x)`) over a method call (`x.len()`), it keeps the door open for extensibility through special methods. Think of `len()` and `abs()` as *unary operators*‚Äîthey're functions on the surface, but they integrate deeply into Python‚Äôs object model.

## The Power of Special Methods

Here‚Äôs a quick cheat sheet of special method categories and some commonly used names:

### Emulating Collections

| Behavior       | Method                     |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Length         | `__len__`                  |
| Indexing       | `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__` |
| Membership     | `__contains__`             |
| Iteration      | `__iter__`, `__next__`, `__reversed__` |

### Numeric Operators

| Operator Type     | Symbols / Methods |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Unary             | `__neg__`, `__pos__`, `__abs__` |
| Arithmetic        | `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, `__floordiv__`, `__mod__`, `__pow__` |
| Reversed          | `__radd__`, `__rsub__`, `__rmul__`, etc. |
| Augmented         | `__iadd__`, `__isub__`, `__imul__`, etc. |

### Comparisons

| Operator | Method        |
|----------|---------------|
| `<`      | `__lt__`      |
| `<=`     | `__le__`      |
| `==`     | `__eq__`      |
| `!=`     | `__ne__`      |
| `>`      | `__gt__`      |
| `>=`     | `__ge__`      |

## Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Use `__len__` when your custom class behaves like a collection.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt override `len()` itself‚ÄîPython calls the special method for you.
- üí° Think of `len()` and `abs()` as part of Python‚Äôs protocol-based design, not just standalone functions.
- üîÑ Keep behavior consistent with Python‚Äôs built-in types when implementing special methods.
